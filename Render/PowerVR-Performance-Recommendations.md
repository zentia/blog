# Introduction
PowerVR SGX and PowerVR Rogue are Graphics Core architectures from Imagination Technologies designed specifically for shader-based APIs such as OpenGL ES 2.0,3.x,and Vulkan.Due to their scalable architectures,the PowerVR family spans a huge performance range.

## Document Overview
This purpose of this document is to serve as recommendation and advice for developers who wish to get the best graphics performance from a PowerVR SGX or PowerVR Rogue enabled device. Throughout the document, the specific recommendations for PowerVR SGX and PowerVR Rogue are marked as appropriate.

## The Golden Rules

The Golden Rules are a set of more generic performance recommendations that developers should seek to implement,as well as observe as many of the techniques and principles mentioned.This should help produce well-behaved,high performance graphics applications.These rules are detailed in the document entitled "PowerVR Performance Recommendations: The Golden Rules",which is supplied with the PowerVR SDK.
